Universal Disassembler program for 8-bit microprocessors

This is a simple disassembler for various 8-bit microprocessors. It
reads a binary file specified on the command line and produces a
disassembly. It requires Python 3. It has been tested on Linux but
should work on any platform that supports Python. See the source code
for more details.

The following CPUs are either supported or planned to be supported:

CPU    Status
---    ------

6502    done

65816   done

65C02   done

6800    done

6801/6803 done

6809    done (incomplete)

6811    done

8080    done

8085    done

8051    done (incomplete)

Z80     done

F8      possible

1802    done

TMS9900 possible


usage: udis.py [-h] [-c CPU] [-n] [-a ADDRESS] [-i] filename

positional arguments:

  filename              Binary file to disassemble

optional arguments:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -c CPU, --cpu CPU     Specify CPU type (defaults to 6502)

  -n, --nolist          Don't list instruction bytes (make output suitable for assembler)

  -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                        Specify decimal starting address (defaults to 0)

  -i, --invalid         Show invalid opcodes as ??? rather than constants
